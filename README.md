# Parakeet AI Desktop UI Clone

This is a desktop UI clone of Parakeet AI, built with Electron. It features a floating, transparent, always-on-top window, styled to resemble Parakeet AI's desktop app.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies (Electron):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Features
- Transparent, frameless, floating window
- Styled UI similar to Parakeet AI desktop
- Content protection enabled (prevents screen capture where supported)

## Notes
- This is UI onlyâ€”no backend/interview logic yet.
- Content protection is best-effort and may not work on all platforms.
